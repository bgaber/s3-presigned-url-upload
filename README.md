# s3-presigned-url-upload
Project to upload pictures to AWS S3 using presigned URLs generated by a Python Lambda function

The two Lambda functions presigned_post.py and presigned_url.py take the following JSON as input:

```
{
bucket: "your bucket name",
key: "your filename.jpg"
}
```

This can be the test event or if using Postman put it in the Body tab as "raw -> JSON"

The Chalice s3_presigned_file_upload Lambda function runs with the API Gateway Endpoint followed with the normal HTTP Get parameter string.

For example:

```
https://API-GW-Generated-String.execute-api.REGION.amazonaws.com/api/generate_presigned_url?file_name=filename.jpg
```

The get-presigned-url.html will output the Pre-Signed URL returned by the Chalice s3_presigned_file_upload Lambda function.
It will need to be modified with your API Gateway Endpoint and filename.
